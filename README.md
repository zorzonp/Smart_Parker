# Smart_Parker
This is a project for ECE601. The goal of the project is to use image recognition to determine license plates as cars enter and exit a parking lot and charge the owner accordingly. 

Smart Parker is an autonomous parking solution designed to limit human interaction, reduce cost and waste, and to increase efficiency. 

The smart parking solution is broken down into three major components:
1) A front-end application in Android for drivers to sign up and change their information
2) A font end application in Python for the attendants at the parking structure to adjust price and process images
3) A back end hosted on an Amazon Web Service virtual instance written in PHP and MySQL that stores the data.
